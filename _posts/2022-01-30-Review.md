### Historical Context
Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the United States declared war on Japan in 1941. The effects of the attack led to widespread panic and anti-Japanese propaganda throughout the US. In 1942, President Roosevelt signed the controversial Executive Order 9066, ordering the relocation of Japanese individuals from the West Coast and deeming the area a war zone. Over 100,000 Japanese Americans were forced into internment camps, two thirds of which were US citizens.
### Relevancy
The project, [_Out of the Desert_](https://outofthedesert.yale.edu), provides users with an interactive way to learn more about US internment camps and the unconstitutional executive order that stripped US citizens of their rights. This project sheds light on the inhumane practice of these camps and brings awareness to those affected by them.
### Credit
The _Out of the Desert_ exhibit initially opened at Yale in 2015 and was turned into an interactive map in 2017 using data from the National Archives. The site utilizes HTML5, Javascript, and CSS3, specifically using the CSS3 calc() function to create the map.
### Design
The site features a map of the US with icons representing each camp. Upon clicking on a camp icon, a sidebar slides out with information about the camp, including its dates, size, number of occupants, and more. Below this is a paragraph containing more in-depth details. At the bottom of the sidebar are newspapers, letters, and stories from the camp for users to read themselves.

There are three tabs on the home page labeled “Design,” “Gallery,” and “Guestbook”. The “Design” tab features information regarding the data used to create the map. The “Gallery” tab features additional primary sources from the camps including paintings, books, postcards, newsletters, and lectures from Yale professors. The “Guestbook” tab allows users to leave an entry or ask questions.

### Findings
The main page of the blog contains a short paragraph in the bottom left hand corner describing the history of the camps with an option to click and learn more in depth information on another page. In the center of the page, the user is prompted to click on the map and learn more about each individual camp. As a visitor of the site, I appreciate the initial introduction into the history of the project with an option to learn more as it gives the viewer some context to what they are about to view.  
When entering the map, the icons are displayed in red font against the cream colored map, ensuring they stand out and are easy to locate. The overall layout of the map is accessible and easy to navigate as well as everything is individually labeled and sectioned off. The brief historical segment remains on the bottom left of the screen and the map takes up a majority of the page as the main attraction. Keeping the historical segment on the main page allows the user to refer back to the introduction at any time with the option to learn more.

The side bar that pops out after clicking on a map icon neatly divides information for the user to read without getting overwhelmed. The presentation of primary source material provides the feel of a hand-on experience as the site allows its users access to scans of personal letters and other materials from inside the camps. It also provides specific information about each item before the user can view it themselves. The background of the sidebar is a deep teal color, standing out against the lighter colors of the map on the main page. Upon clicking on a primary source, the screen becomes completely black with white text briefly explaining the source. The scan of the document takes center stage as the darkened background serves to emphasize the document itself.

Because the map is only discussing the US, specifically the West Coast, I do not think the creators of the project needed to add the zoom feature as it distracts from the project itself. When looking at the map, you can zoom out to show the entire globe and other countries, with each country, state, and city listed. I frequently found myself accidentally zooming out and needing to reload the page to get back to the US. Because the project only focuses on the US, this feature feels unnecessary, takes away from the main point of the project, and overpopulates the map.

	In the “Gallery” tab at the top of the main page, the sources and videos are thrown together and lack organization. When looking through this section, I was very confused as to what the videos were of since they were not labeled and found it hard to easily locate specific items. I would recommend sorting each document into categories: “Articles,” “Lectures,” “Letters,” “Books,” “Paintings,” etcetera. This way the information is organized and more accessible to the viewer.

	Overall, the site is very effective in it’s goal to distribute lots of valuable information regarding the use of US Japanese internment camps during World War II. It’s simple layout helps viewers obtain lots of data in a way that does not overwhelm the audience. The majority of the site presents it’s data in a neatly organized manner, with exception of the Gallery tab. I appreciate the attention to detail with the use of the same font, _Futura_, that was used in the original executive order. It brings the situation full circle as the font used within the document that was responsible for the incident is now being used within a project that educates and brings awareness to the time period.
