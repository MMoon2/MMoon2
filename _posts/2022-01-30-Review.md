### Historical Context
Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, the United States declared war on Japan in 1941. The effects of the attack led to widespread panic and anti-Japanese propaganda throughout the US. In 1942, President Roosevelt signed the controversial Executive Order 9066, ordering the relocation of Japanese individuals from the West Coast and deeming the area a war zone.

### Relevancy
The project, [_Out of the Desert_](https://outofthedesert.yale.edu), provides users with an interactive way to learn more about US internment camps and the unconstitutional executive order that stripped US citizens of their rights. This project sheds light on the inhumane practice of these camps and brings awareness to those affected by them.

### Credit
The [_Out of the Desert_](https://outofthedesert.yale.edu) exhibit initially opened at Yale in 2015 and was turned into an interactive map in 2017 using data from the National Archives. The site utilizes HTML5, Javascript, and CSS3, specifically using the CSS3 calc() function to create the map.

### Design
The site features a map of the US with icons representing each camp. Upon clicking on a camp icon, a sidebar slides out with information about the camp, including its dates, size, number of occupants, and more. Below this is a paragraph containing more in-depth details. At the bottom of the sidebar are newspapers, letters, and stories from the camp for users to read themselves.

There are three tabs on the home page labeled “Design,” “Gallery,” and “Guestbook”. The “Design” tab features information regarding the data used to create the map. The “Gallery” tab features additional primary sources from the camps including paintings, books, postcards, newsletters, and lectures from Yale professors. The “Guestbook” tab allows users to leave an entry or ask questions.

### Findings
The blog's main page contains a short paragraph along the bottom of the screen describing the project's historical context with an option to click and learn more. As a visitor of the site, I appreciate the initial introduction into the history of the project with an option to learn more on a separate page as it gives the audience background into the project. The brief historical segment remains on the bottom left of the screen as you enter the map on the main page. By keeping the historical segment on the main page, the users are able to refer back to at any time if they have questions or would like to learn more.

The sidebar neatly divides information for the user to read without getting overwhelmed. The presentation of primary sources provides the feel of a hands-on experience as the site allows its users access to scans of personal letters and other materials from the camps. The background of the sidebar is a deep teal color, standing out against the lighter colors of the map on the main page. Upon clicking on a primary source, the screen becomes completely black with white text briefly explaining the source. The scan of the document takes center stage as the darkened background serves to emphasize the document itself.

The overall layout of the map is very organized as everything is individually labeled and sectioned off. Because the map is only discussing the US, I do not think the creators needed to add the zoom feature as it distracts from the project itself. When looking at the map, you can zoom out to show the entire globe with each country, state, and city outlined. I frequently found myself accidentally zooming out instead of in and then needing to reload the page to get back to the US on the map. Because the project only focuses on the US, this feature feels unnecessary and takes away from the main point of the project.

In the “Gallery” tab at the top of the main page, the sources and videos are thrown together and lack organization. When looking through this section, I was very confused as to the purpose of the videos since they were not labeled. I would recommend sorting each document into categories to organize the information and make it more accessible.

Overall, the site is very effective in it’s goal to distribute lots of valuable information in an effective manner. I appreciate the attention to detail within the decision to use the same font, _Futura_, that was used to write the original executive order. This detail brings the project full circle as the font used within the document that was responsible for causing such harm is now being used within a project that educates and brings awareness to the incident.
