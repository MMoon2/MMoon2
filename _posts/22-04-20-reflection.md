# Reflection
#### By Meghan Moon


I initially signed up for this course because I felt that learning how to write for the digital humanities would greatly help me in my future career. I have interned as a marketing/ social media manager a few times with different organizations and creating content and written communication to disperse digitally was vital to the job.  

Learning how to write in a more concise manner while remaining professional was something that I looked forward to learning and practicing within this course. When the course began, I was very excited to learn TEI coding and Github as I enjoy the process of coding and have heard a lot about Github that I wanted to explore for myself.  

As the course progressed and we began using these tools, I was able to learn the ways around them and the best ways to communicate through them as well. For example, writing in smaller, more concise sections in Github has helped me while posting on different social media platforms professionally. 
My experience in the class has been positive as I have been given the opportunity to learn new things, practice my communication skills within different platforms, such as Github and Twitter, and receive peer feedback on all of my writings. 

The peer feedback, in particular, was something that was very beneficial to me, and I am sure many of my classmates as well, because it allowed a second set of eyes to read over my work. This not only provided me with tips and feedback I had not considered before, but it allowed a fresh set of eyes to offer different points of view regarding my work. I made sure I never missed a peer review session for this specific reason. 
I always found that my final product was better than my draft after having someone else give me their thoughts and feedback. Everyone has a different point of view of the world and, therefore, has something new to offer to every project. 

After taking this course, I definitely feel that my understanding of Digital Humanities has widened and I am able to more clearly define the field itself. In the beginning of the course, we were asked to define Digital Humanities within a Google Doc and at the end of the semester, we revised this definition to our current understanding of the field. 

My initial definition was quite broad as I had an idea of the concept but had never been given the chance to create or work with a digital humanities project before. My first definition was as follows: “Digital Humanities refer to the field that surrounds understanding the humanities through the use of technology.” 

Although not an incorrect definition, my newer definition gives further examples in order to explain the outcome of the field, stating: “Digital Humanities refers to educating an audience through the use of technology, such as digital maps, 3D reconstructions, interactive timelines, and more.” 
As you can see, the ability to work directly with, and consider creating our own, Digital Humanities projects allowed me to better understand the significance and purpose of the field. 

The readings were beneficial in giving in-depth explanations or providing examples as to Digital Humanities and the current assignments we were working on. I really enjoyed one of the first assigned readings which was the website that gave hundreds of different definitions of the field. This site gave great insight to Digital Humanities and provided different definitions that each resonate with someone different. I also really enjoyed the eye-tracking reading that discussed where people tend to look when entering a website. As someone who enjoys coding and creating websites, working with websites, and managing social media for organizations, this information was very helpful and I have taken it into consideration on every project that I work on since then.

The project that helped me the most in the class was the Digital Humanities review blog. This assignment gave me the opportunity to analyze a DH project in depth and discuss my findings, likes, dislikes, and overall analysis. Without this blog, I do not think I would have done well writing my grant proposal as it presented me with a basis to go off of and inspiration to draw from. Having an idea of what a proper DH site should look like, how it should or shouldn’t operate, and how different types of software work, greatly assisted me in writing my grant proposal. 

If there were anything I might change to the course, it would be adding a class period to discuss different types of software Digital Humanists work with the most. Knowing which software would be the best for mapping, or making a 3D reconstruction, will help students when writing their proposal to understand what software might work best for their project.

Overall, the class has helped me immensely with my writing skills and has introduced me to new tools through projects and proposal research that I will utilize often in my future career!
