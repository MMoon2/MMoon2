# A Little About Me

### By Meghan Moon

My name is Meghan Moon and I am a senior at Christopher Newport University. Upon arriving on campus in August of 2018, I was ready to begin pursuing a degree in political science. Because of my lifelong passion for the subject, I had always felt that the path that lay ahead of me was a career in politics. After my first year, I came to the realization that a life of stress and frustration may not be as fun as I had originally presumed. 

As a result, I met with my advisor who asked me a series of questions about my passions, all of which contained some aspect of communication. This conversation allowed me to see that a degree in communication is what was best suited for me. 

However, I was not new to the field as I was in my high school’s Mass Communication specialty center program. What this meant is that I had applied and been accepted into a program which centers your main highschool courses around a specific program. Each of the highschools in my county had a niche and I had applied to the Mass Communication program offered at my districted school. 

Within this program, I learned the ins and outs of photoshop, video editing, print journalism, and broadcast journalism. During my highschool career I produced dozens of photoshop designs, newspaper layouts, news segments, and even served as the news anchor on our school news show, _MHS Voice_. 

My advisor also discussed the three focus areas of the Communication major and I immediately was drawn to the media focus due to my background in the field. It was during this conversation that I was also introduced to the Digital Humanities minor. Although I did not understand the complex definition of the field at first, I found the course descriptions intriguing and felt that a minor within this field would complement my major.

Throughout my time at CNU, my career goals have changed as my interests have varied. The courses I have enjoyed the most have been the required writing seminars and the courses I have taken for my minor: _Introduction to Digital Humanities_ and _Introduction to Digital media_. Within the latter courses I learned graphic design, website design, and marketing strategies. 

As I have completed more and more courses, it has become apparent that my interests lie within two main areas: english/ journalism and digital marketing/ technology. I worked with the Center for Career Planning and came to the conclusion that a career within Public Relations is the path I’d like to take!

When looking at my areas of interest and the subjects I most enjoyed, I realized my career goals would need to incorporate some sort of marketing aspect, preferably digital, and english aspect. Public Relations brings all of these fields together as it requires knowledge of strategic communication, journalistic writing, marketing, and Social Networking Sites. 

While at CNU, I have interned for two organizations as a social media and marketing manager. The first was for a nonprofit organization and the second was for the CNU English department. Both positions consisted of creating marketing campaigns for social media, designing and creating content, updating socials, tracking analytics, and more. 

As far as my post-graduation plans go, I have been accepted into graduate school and plan to begin an accelerated 12 month program in September, pursuing a Master of Arts in Public Relations. I am **so** excited to graduate with my bachelors in communication from an amazing institution and take the next step in furthering my career goals.
