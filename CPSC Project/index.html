<h2>About the Lancers</h2>
    <p class="pcolor">Dubbed "Virginia's finest" by the National Swim Review in 2021, the <span class="lancer">Lancer Swim Team</span> was created in 2012 by the National Swim Organization (NSO) in an effort to spread the sport of swimming to highschool students around the country.</p>
    <p class="pcolor">Our team has since competed in over 100 meets with several swimmers setting state and national records. The team travels to different aquatic centers around the country to compete, along with a free, week-long exhibition with former olympians towards the beginning of each season.</p>
